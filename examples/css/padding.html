<div class="b-red">Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. Watch it, Goldie. What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties? Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it.</div>
<div class="p-25 b-red">Alright, take it up, go. Doc. Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines. He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. Ah, where're my pants?</div>
<div class="px-25 b-red">C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Oh, what I meant to day was- Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? That's a big bruise you have there.</div>
<div class="pl-25 b-red">You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. We never would have fallen in love. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Thank you. In about thirty years. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here.</div>
